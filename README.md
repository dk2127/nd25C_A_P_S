# U_d_a_c_i_t_y C_a_p_s_t_o_n_e P_r_o_j_e_c_t - S_t_a_r_b_u_c_k_s Offer Analytics

# Introduction / Overview


We will leverage what weâ€™ve learned throughout the program to build a data science project, for S_t_a_r_b_u_c_k_s Offer Analytics.


We have datasets containing simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the S_t_a_r_b_u_c_k_s rewards mobile app. Once every few days, S_t_a_r_b_u_c_k_s sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set. This data set is a simplified version of the real S_t_a_r_b_u_c_k_s app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas S_t_a_r_b_u_c_k_s actually sells dozens of products.

## Objective

Our objective is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. 


# Steps

We will be following steps of the data science process:

- First we will define the problem we want to solve and investigate potential solutions.
- Next, we will perform analysis through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving the problem.
- We  will then implement the algorithms/models and metrics, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and post-processing steps along the way.
- Afterward, we will collect results about our findings, visualize significant quantities, validate/justify our results, and make any concluding remarks about whether our implementation adequately solves the problem.
- We will construct a Capstone Project Report as a blog post to document all of the steps from start to finish of our project and provide link at the bottom of this page.

# File Descriptions

We are given the data in three files. Below is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:

### portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer

- id (string) - offer id
- offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational
- difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer
- reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer
- duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days
- channels (list of strings)

### profile.json - demographic data for each customer

- age (int) - age of the customer
- became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account
- gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)
- id (str) - customer id
- income (float) - customer's income

### transcript.json -  records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

- event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)
- person (str) - customer id
- time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0
- value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record


# Conclusion
   
The Capstone Project Report that will have project definition, data exploration, anlyasis, metrics, results, and conclusion. The report will be posted on Medium as a blog(link).
